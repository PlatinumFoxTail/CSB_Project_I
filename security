FLAW 1:

https://github.com/PlatinumFoxTail/CSB_Project_I/blob/96999f8c7453229fbd3107007d5682b8f0406280/src/pages/views.py#L23

Description of flaw 1:
The inserted flaw is Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF). By marking the transfer view with the csrf_exempt decorator, Django does not
require a CSRF protection cookie. Imagine an attacker creates a malicious website with a hidden form that submits a POST request to 
the homePageView on the banktransfer application. The attacker fools an authenticated user to visit the malicious website. Since the 
homePageView is decorated with @csrf_exempt, the server will not require a CSRF token for the POST request. As a result, the user's 
browser unknowingly performs the financial transfer, resulting in unauthorized transactions without the user's approval.

How to fix flaw 1:
To fix the CSRF vulnerability, remove the @csrf_exempt decorator from the homePageView view.
